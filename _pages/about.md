I am a final-year PhD student at the University of Cambridge and a cosmologist specialising in the development of machine-learning-enhanced Bayesian inference tools to understand the structure, evolution, and composition of the universe.

I am the author of [unimpeded](https://github.com/handley-lab/unimpeded), a Python package that transforms months of supercomputer calculations into seconds on the laptops of cosmologists and astrophysicists, democratising access to expensive nested sampling chains, enabling cosmological model comparison and observational dataset analysis for researchers worldwide.

**Research Interests:** Cosmology, Astrophysics, Bayesian Statistics, Machine Learning, Model Comparison, Tension Quantification, Nested Sampling
