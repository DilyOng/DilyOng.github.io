I am a current member of [The Handley Research Group](https://handley-lab.co.uk/) led by [Dr Will Handley](https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/directory/wh260), based in the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge. Our research focuses on Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and data analysis for astrophysics, cosmology and high energy physics.
